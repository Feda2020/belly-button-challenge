## Description

This web application is an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare. 
The dashboard allows users to select a sample from a dropdown and view detailed metadata and visualizations, including bar and bubble charts. This project is ideal for exploring microbiological datasets in a clean, accessible format.

## Overview

* **Sample Selection:** Choose from a list of bacterial samples via a dropdown menu.
* **Metadata Display:** View specific metadata for the selected sample, including information such as sample ID, location, and other relevant details.
* **Data Visualizations:**
- **Horizontal Bar Chart:** with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
- **Bubble Chart:** Displays each sample with color and size variations representing different species and values.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript with D3.**js for data manipulation and fetching.
- **Plotly.js** for creating interactive charts.
- **HTML & CSS** for structuring and styling the application.

## Usage
1. **Select a Sample:** Use the dropdown menu at the top to select a sample.
2. **View Metadata:** The metadata panel will populate with details related to the selected sample.
3. **Explore Visualizations:** The bar and bubble charts update to reflect the selected sample.
